# 3D Target Tracking with Kalman Filter (Python)
This project implements a Kalman Filter to track a moving target in 3D space (X, Y, Z) using noisy radar measurements. The Kalman filter helps in reducing noise and improving tracking accuracy over time.

## How It Works
1. *Generates a target moving from (0,0,0) to (100,50,20).*  
2. *Adds radar noise to simulate real-world tracking errors.*  
3. *Applies Kalman Filter for real-time position correction.*  
4. *Plots the results in a 3D visualization.*
